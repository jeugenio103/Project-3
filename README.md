# Project #3
> Analysis of Asian influence on Spotify and compare streaming of Asian American artists (88rising) to all artists streamed in United States. We will look at Spotify data to analyze. Given the increased diversification in mainstream media, we were interested to see what impact Asian Americans and Asians have made in the music industry in recent times. We specifically wanted to analyze data from 88rising, an American based music company that exclusively represents Asian American and Asian music artists.<br><br>

## Popularity-Analysis
For this section, we wanted to focus on the top 10 most listened to artists on Spotify, and the top 10 88rising artists based on monthly listeners. 
At first glance, you can see that the 88rising artists are pulling in about 10% of the monthly listeners of the top mainstream artists. The Weeknd is leading in monthly listeners with 78,767,075 monthly listeners, and 10th place being Dua Lipa with 60,387,424. For 88rising, Joji is leading that group with 30,050,750 monthly listeners, and 10th place being Guapdad 4000 with 975,759.<br><br>

When looking at the debut comparison chart, we can see that all of the 88rising artists debuted after all of the top mainstream artists. The mainstream artists all debuted between the late 90s to early 2010s, where all of 88 rising debuted officially from 2015 to 2020.<br><br>

Within these artists lists, their music genre encompasses:
['R&B', 'Pop', 'Hip Hop', 'Dance Pop', 'Alternative', 'Folk', 'Rock', 'Trap', 'EDM', 'Kpop', 'Misc.']
Top 3 categories for the mainstream artists are: pop, r&b, hip hop
Top 3 categories for the 88rising artists are: hiphop, r&b, misc
Misc: includes lofi, thai-pop, trip-hop<br><br>

We can see that hip hop and r&b overlaps both groups and most likely plays a role in what is marketable to the Spotify users and audience. However, 88rising having more uncommon genres incorporated within their artists sets them apart and are memorable for their listeners.
